Notice from <%= @invitation.agency.name %>

Hello <%= @invitation.contact.name %>,

We are sorry to inform you that you have tested positive for COVID-19. We ask that you <b>please self-isolate for the next 7 days</b>, or until 3 days after your symptoms have completely resolved, whichever is longer. If your symptoms get worse, please phone your primary care practitioner to seek guidance before going to the hospital.

In an effort to stop transmission of COVID-19, the public health department is asking individuals who have COVID-19 to answer a 10 minute survey to find people you may have had contact with while you were infectious. Your participation will help us find other people who might have COVID-19 before they transmit their infection to someone else. Please take the survey by visiting this link:
